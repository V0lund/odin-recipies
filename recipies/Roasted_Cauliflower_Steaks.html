    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cauliflower steaks made oven roasted with simple seasonings like salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Cutting the cauliflower into thick slices makes for a hearty and satisfying plant-based meal. I recommend serving these vegetable steaks with a flavorful sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 heads cauliflower</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to the lower third position. Preheat to 500ºF (260ºC).</li>
            <li>Remove the outer green leaves from the head of cauliflower and trim the stem.</li>
            <li>Using a large knife cut the cauliflower in half lengthwise through the center.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Pan – Lightly brush a large baking sheet with olive oil. Evenly sprinkle cornmeal on the pan if desired for a crunchy crust texture.</li>
            <li>Shape the Dough – On a lightly floured surface, stretch and shape the dough into a 10-inch circle—transfer to the baking sheet. Use fingers to press into a 12-inch circle. Leave the edges slightly thicker, about ½-inch tall and wide.</li>
            <li>Add the Toppings – Spread the pizza sauce over the dough, followed by the mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, sausage, and bacon. Sprinkle on oregano and red pepper flakes, if desired.</li>
            <li>Bake – On the lowest oven rack, cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve – Immediately slice and serve while still hot.</li>
        </ol>
