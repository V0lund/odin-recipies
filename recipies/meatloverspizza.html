    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Are you feeding a hungry family on game day? <br> This homemade meat lover’s pizza loaded with four types of proteins will easily do the trick.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pizza dough</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for brushing</li>
        <li>8 ounces Italian sausage, mild or spicy</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornmeal, optional</li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce, or marinara sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the Oven – Set the oven rack to the lower position and the temperature to 500ºF (260ºC).</li>
            <li>Prepare the Dough – Allow the prepared pizza dough to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook the Sausage – In a medium skillet or saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the meat, breaking it into small pieces. Cook until browned, about 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to cool while preparing the rest of the pizza.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Pan – Lightly brush a large baking sheet with olive oil. Evenly sprinkle cornmeal on the pan if desired for a crunchy crust texture.</li>
            <li>Shape the Dough – On a lightly floured surface, stretch and shape the dough into a 10-inch circle—transfer to the baking sheet. Use fingers to press into a 12-inch circle. Leave the edges slightly thicker, about ½-inch tall and wide.</li>
            <li>Add the Toppings – Spread the pizza sauce over the dough, followed by the mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, sausage, and bacon. Sprinkle on oregano and red pepper flakes, if desired.</li>
            <li>Bake – On the lowest oven rack, cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve – Immediately slice and serve while still hot.</li>
        </ol>
